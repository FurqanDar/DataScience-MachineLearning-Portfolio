# Iris Dataset

Here, in the companion jupyter notebook, we take a close look at the classical iris dataset. Here, for three different species of Iris, we have measurements of the sepal/petal length/width. The usual data mining goal is to learn how to predict the species of the iris given these 4 measurements.

In the companion notebook, rather than immediately treating the task as a supervised classification problem (which we _do_ at the end), we instead try various (semi-)supervised clustering techniques, and dimensional reduction via PCA, to generate models that can predict the iris species reliably.
