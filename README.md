# Data Science / Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

This repository is a collection of prototypical data science problems, with an emphasis on business-related problems and their canonical solutions.

1. [Iris Dataset](Iris_DataSet/README.md). We look at the classical iris dataset problem. Rather than strictly treating it as a classification problem, we use a semi-supervised clustering analysis to predict iris species. Performing dimensional reduction with PCA, furthermore, then allows us to use only two features to reliably predict the class.
2. [Churn prediction](TelcoCustomerChurn/README.md). We analyze Telecom customer data, from Kaggle, to identify key drivers for churn, and customers with the highest risk. With the trained models, we can give specific retention driving solutions, and predict the ROI for a targeted ads/deals campaign.
